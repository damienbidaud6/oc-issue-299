Test repo to chat about that issue. 

### To run with client-side rendering

```sh
npm i
npm start
# will start oc registry at port 3030 and http-server for serving test page (index.html) at http://localhost:3000 - to change ports edit package.json
open http://localhost:3000
```

This should show the test page with client-side rendered component. Looking at console it should be possible to verify execution of client-side js files.
